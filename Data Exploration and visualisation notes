 Business Case: Netflix - Data Exploration and Visualisation

My observations in data:
1)Missing values in columns like-director,cast,country
2)Multiple values present in certain columns
3)Duration column has a mixture of  numerical and string values like 90min and also seasons
4)Different columns have different datatypes like objects and integers.
5)There is a lot of categorical data for which some can be converted into numerical:for ex:duration column can be converted to numerical which helps us in finding average duration time of the shows
6)Most of the TV shows available are rated as TV-MA
7)The percentage of Tv shows to movies is 30:70
8)The given data helps us to find average tv show and movies time
9)It also helps us to find actors who have acted in most of the movies/tv shows aired on netflix
10)This data helps us to understand the customer preferences based on different genres,actors,directors and helps us decide the type of movies/shows to be aired.


Tasks done:
Identified the basic characteristics of data
Observed the shape of data,unique valules,data types,null values and changed the null values accordingly(For director column and actor column whose country isnt mentioned)
Performed non graphica; analysis
Resolved the nested data issue for directors,cast,country,Genre and merged it back with the original data
Resolved the issue in rating column where there was duration value (say 20min instead of Not rated) for non rated movies/series.


Performed univariate analysis in terms of count in columns and identified:
1)Number of distinct titles on the basis of genre-International Movies, Dramas and Comedies are the most popular .
2)Number of distinct titles on the basis of type.It shows 70:30 ratio of Movies and TV Shows

Charts/Graphs
Depicted the no. of distinct titles on basis of genre - bar graph using Matplotlib
Depicted the no. of distinct titles on the basis of type--Pie chart
